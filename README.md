# C compiler in Rust

This is a personal project of mine where I follow [Nora Sandler's blog posts](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html) and try to write a C compiler in Rust.

I won't be accepting any pull requests since I actually want to learn Rust but if you have any suggestions/improvements (related to rust-specific stuff for now) you can open an issue for it and I'll have a look at it.

You are free to do to do whatever you want with the code so have fun!
